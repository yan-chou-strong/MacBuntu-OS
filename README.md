# MacBuntu-OS
This is the MacOS Transformation Pack for Ubuntu! It should theoretically work with other Linux distros but I haven't tried it so I don't know :)

### Hiding the Launcher

2. Click on ```Behaviour```, then click on ```Auto-hide the launcher```
3. Set the reveal sensitivity slider to the lowest setting.

### Finishing touches

Lets add some finishing touches by changing up the ```Ubuntu Desktop``` text on the panel. :)

1. Open up ```Terminal``` and type in the following:
  * ```cd && wget -O Mac.po http://drive.noobslab.com/data/Mac/change-name-on-panel/mac.po```
  * and then ```cd /usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES; sudo msgfmt -o unity.mo ~/Mac.po;rm ~/Mac.po;cd```

After you're done with all of this, reboot your pc and enjoy MacBuntu OS!
